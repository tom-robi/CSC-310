kd-tree with 2 dimensions
matplotlib.pyplot for visualizing the nearest point function at work

init
creation of a node class, where each point is a coordinate in k-dimensional space
axis determines splitting dimension, references the left and right children

build_kdtree
recursively builds the kd-tree
k is set to however many dimensions the first point has
axis is calculated depth modulo k
display geeks4geeks diagram
recursively builds left and right subrees before and after median

distance_squared
calculates distance between points

closest_point
Travels tree recursively, keeping track of best/closest point
until it reaches the end of the tree.
Updates if a closer point is found.

plot_kdtree
recursively plots structure of kdtree, with horizontal or vertical lines

finally, the points are plotted
